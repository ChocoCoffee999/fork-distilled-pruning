# Distilled Pruning: Using Synthetic Data to Win the Lottery

This repo is based off of MTT (see https://georgecazenavette.github.io/mtt-distillation).  We included two notebooks named DistilledPruning for each dataset that contains all the sufficient code for the paper. Instructions to run those is in the notebook. All code is assumed to run on CUDA and has been developed on Paperspace's Pytorch Image.

This is a work in progress and paper will be linked soon. Submitted to AutoML workshop 2023 or CVPR 2023 NAS workshop.
